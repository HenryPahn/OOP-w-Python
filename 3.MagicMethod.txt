1. + operator overloading
- use "add" magic to overload the summation:
    def __add__(self, other): 
        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
    
2. object function 
- use "call" magic to make the instance of the class callable: 
    def __call__(self): 
        print("I was called")
